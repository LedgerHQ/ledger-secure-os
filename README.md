# BOLOS public sources

This repository contains public parts of Ledger proprietary operating system (BOLOS).

Only a few pieces of the OS are available as of today, but [more will come in the future](https://twitter.com/P3b7_/status/1661012196397305859/photo/1).

## [Dashboard](dashboard)

The `dashboard` layer handles APDUs coming from the host.  Among other topics, this layer covers APDUs regarding to:

- [Secure Channel communication and Genuineness certification](dashboard/src/dashboard_scp.c)

- [Apps management](dashboard/src/dashboard_registry.c) / [Apps listing](dashboard/src/dashboard_list.c)

All the available APDUs are described [here](dashboard/include/dashboard.h).
