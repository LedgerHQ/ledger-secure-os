# Source Code Accessibility License
v.1.0

The purpose of this license agreement (the “License”) is to enable the holder of economic rights (the “Licensor”) on a software (the “Software”) to open safely its source code (the “Source Code”) in order to allow its observation and study by the community (the “Audit Purpose”) and its potential adaptation, compilation and loading for the Licensee’s own needs strictly for use on the Licensor’s devices only (the “Personal Compilation Purpose”).

Under this Licence, the Licensor grants to you and the entity on behalf of which you may act (altogether where relevant, the “Licensee”) the necessary rights to pursue the Audit Purpose and the Personal Compilation Purpose.

This License may apply to any Software for which the Licensor decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions. This will allow everyone who wishes to do so to determine the ideas and principles behind any or all constituent elements of all covered Software.

## Article 2 – Feedbacks
2.1 Licensees can provide the Licensor with any comment on the Source Code to improve it.

## Article 4 – Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability
4.1 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE AND THE SOURCE CODE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE SOURCE CODE IS LICENSED “AS-IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE ABSENCE OF DEFECTS OR ERRORS, FITNESS FOR THE AUTHORIZED PURPOSES AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

4.2 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT IN THE CASES OF WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR DAMAGES DIRECTLY CAUSED TO NATURAL PERSONS WHERE AND TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT NECESSARY APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, EITHER MATERIAL OR MORAL, DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSE AND OF THE USE OF THE SOURCE CODE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PECUNIARY OR BUSINESS LOSS, COMPUTER FAILING OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OPERATING LOSS, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS OR ORDERS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY COST, WORK STOPPAGE AND ANY OTHER DISTURBANCE TO BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST THE LICENSEE BY A THIRD PARTY).

4.3 REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER PROVISION IN OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE LICENSEE AND THE LICENSOR, IF THE LICENSEE ADAPT THE SOURCE CODE UNDER THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL, EITHER MATERIAL OR MORAL, DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOURCE CODE THUS ADAPTED AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE LICENSOR’S HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

4.4 This disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the granting of rights provided herein.

4.5 Neither party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the License, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

7.2 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable regulation or were to be found by any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, this will not affect the validity or the enforceability of the License as a whole, which will continue to be valid and enforceable as to the other provisions and the remainder of the affected provision. Such provision will be construed or reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and unenforceable.
